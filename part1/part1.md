1. At line 11, the value of i will be prices.length and that will be logged on the console. Although the variable i was created in the for loop, variables created with "var" do not have any block scope. This means that they only have function-scope or global-scope, and they visible through all other code blocks. Once the for loop is complete, console.log() will be able to access i and there will not be any errors.
2. At line 12, the value of discountedPrice will be the final value of discountedPrice from the for loop and that will be logged on the console. Although the variable discountedPrice was created in the for loop, variables created with "var" do not have any block scope. This means that they only have function-scope or global-scope, and they visible through all other code blocks. Once the for loop is complete, console.log() will be able to access discountedPrice and there will not be any errors.
3. At line 13, the value of finalPrice will be the final value of finalPrice from the for loop and that will be logged on the console. The variable finalPrice was created in the function discountPrices(). Since variables created with "var" have function-scope, console.log() will be able to access finalPrice and there will not be any errors.
4. The function discountPrices() takes in an array of prices and a discount, applies the given discount to each price in the array and returns an array of the discounted prices. Therefore, when given the prices [100, 200, 300] and the discount 0.5, the function will discount each item by 50% (as calculated in line 6 when we multiply the price with with 1-discount, resulting in the discounted price). Each discounted price is calculated in the for loop in this way, and the price is added to the discounted array. Once the for loop is complete, the function returns the discounted array. In this case, the function returns discounted which is the array [50, 100, 150].
