1. At line 11, the value of i will be prices.length and that will be logged on the console. Although the variable i was created in the for loop, variables created with "var" do not have any block scope. This means that they only have function-scope or global-scope, and they visible through all other code blocks. Once the for loop is complete, console.log() will be able to access i and there will not be any errors.
2. At line 12, the value of discountedPrice will be the final value of discountedPrice from the for loop and that will be logged on the console. Although the variable discountedPrice was created in the for loop, variables created with "var" do not have any block scope. This means that they only have function-scope or global-scope, and they visible through all other code blocks. Once the for loop is complete, console.log() will be able to access discountedPrice and there will not be any errors.
3. At line 13, the value of finalPrice will be the final value of finalPrice from the for loop and that will be logged on the console. The variable finalPrice was created in the function discountPrices(). Since variables created with "var" have function-scope, console.log() will be able to access finalPrice and there will not be any errors.
4. The function discountPrices() takes in an array of prices and a discount, applies the given discount to each price in the array and returns an array of the discounted prices. Therefore, when given the prices [100, 200, 300] and the discount 0.5, the function will discount each item by 50% (as calculated in line 6 when we multiply the price with with 1-discount, resulting in the discounted price). Each discounted price is calculated in the for loop in this way, and the price is added to the discounted array. Once the for loop is complete, the function returns the discounted array. The discounted array is maintained through the function because it was created using "var" at the beginning of the function, and variables created with "var" have function scope. In this case, the function returns discounted which is the array [50, 100, 150].
5. At line 11, there will be a ReferenceError stating that i is not defined. This is because the variable i was created using "let" within the scope of the for loop, meaning that i is only accessible within the for loop. Although the variable i is created in the construct of the for loop, this variable is still considered a part of the for block. Variables created with "let" have block-scope (unlike variables created with "var"). Therefore, once the for loop is complete, console.log() will not be able to access i and there will not be a ReferenceError.
6. Line 12 will not be executed unless line 11 is removed since line 11 causes a ReferenceError as stated in question 5. At line 12 (ignoring line 11), there will be a ReferenceError stating that discountedPrice is not defined. This is because the variable discountedPrice was created using "let" within the scope of the for loop, meaning that discountedPrice is only accessible within the for loop. Variables created with "let" have block-scope (unlike variables created with "var"). Therefore, once the for loop is complete, console.log() will not be able to access discountedPrice and there will not be a ReferenceError.
7. Line 13 will not be executed unless lines 11 and 12 are removed since lines 11 and 12 cause ReferenceErrors as stated in questions 5 and 6 respectively. At line 13 (ignoring lines 11 and 12), the value of finalPrice will be the final value of finalPrice from the for loop and that will be logged on the console. The variable finalPrice was created in the function discountPrices() and initialized to 0. Afterwards, the value of finalPrice was updated in the for loop. Since variables created with "let" have function-scope, this is allowed and the value of finalPrice will be successfully updated in the for loop. Since variables created with "let" have function-scope, console.log() will be able to access finalPrice and there will not be any errors.
8. The function will not return any value unless lines 11 and 12 are removed since lines 11 and 12 cause ReferenceErrors as stated in questions 5 and 6 respectively. Ignoring these lines, we know the function discountPrices() takes in an array of prices and a discount, applies the given discount to each price in the array and returns an array of the discounted prices. Therefore, when given the prices [100, 200, 300] and the discount 0.5, the function will discount each item by 50% (as calculated in line 6 when we multiply the price with with 1-discount, resulting in the discounted price). Each discounted price is calculated in the for loop in this way, and the price is added to the discounted array. Once the for loop is complete, the function returns the discounted array. The discounted array is maintained through the function because it was created using "let" at the beginning of the function, and variables created with "let" have function scope. In this case, the function returns discounted which is the array [50, 100, 150].
